#### Homework due Monday February 3 
- **Read**
	- [Machinations-Mechanisms](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses/blob/master/doc/machinations-mechanisms.pdf)
	- [Basic
		Mechanisms](https://web.archive.org/web/20170727010622/http://www.mechanical-toys.com/mechanisums.htm)

- **Do**
	- Start building your hand crank machine using a crank and any 
		other mechanism (linkage, cam, etc.). It is fine to copy my example.
		You don't need to finish this project by Monday, but I do want you to 
		find out where you have problems

- **Optional**
	- Browse [Mechatronics
 Resources](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#mechatronic-resources)

## Monday 3 February 2019 10:25 AM - 1:05 PM

**Share Projects**
- What did you learn?


**Demonstration**
- Cardboard construction techniques

**Demonstration**
- Soldering pins to scrap boards
	- Nice cone
	- Not too much, not too little solder
- Soldering pins to shields
	- Keep pins straight
	- Keep solder away from length of pins

#### Homework due Wednesday February 5 

1. Finish your hand crank machine, using the feedback you received in class
	 today
1. Download and install the [Arduino
	 IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) (not the web editor)
1. If you are new to Arduino read the following:
	1. Arduino basics: Intro through Lesson 3 of Adafruit's Arduino
		 [tutorial](http://www.ladyada.net/learn/arduino/index.html)
	1. The first four tutorials from
		 [here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#basic-arduino-resources-from-arduino)

## Wednesday 5 February 2020 11:50 AM - 1:05 PM

Look at projects

**Do Along with Me**
- Arduino

#### Homework due Monday February 10 
(revised Feb 6)

1. If you've never used it before,
	learn about the Adafruit motor shield by reading the sixth resource
	[here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#motors-resources).
	Don't worry about all the details, just get the general picture.
1. Create a github account (if you don't have one) and a repository 
	for this class by following the first resource 
	[here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#github-resources).
	1. Name the repository "machineLab".
	1. Email me a link to your repository
1. If you don't have Google Chrome browser on your laptop, install it from

## Monday 3 February 2019 10:25 AM - 1:05 PM

**Administration**
- Label shelves

**Be excellent to the lab**
- It is super critical to keep tools, parts, and the lab in general neat.
- If tools or parts can't be found it's the same as them not existing and it
	holds everyone up including me
- If you don't know where something goes ask me or a lab manager or a lab
	monitor. If no one in the lab knows leave it on your shelf and send me
	email.
- Always (**Always!**) leave the lab cleaner than you found it. Clean up 
whatever mess you made, and a little more
- We are going to be making more stuff than any other class, so if there
    is a mess, everyone will know it's us.
- If I find out that you are being a bad lab citizen, it will affect your
	grade


**Do Along with Me**
- Motor Shield
- Stepper motor

**Time Permitting**
- Circuits
- Voltage and Current
- Transistors and Motors

**Creating a design for the laser cutter**

#### Homework due Wednesday February 12

Do your best to create the design I sketched on the board for the laser cutter.
The purpose of this assignment is not necessarily to finish the design
perfectly, but to get practice using Illustrator. You will need holes for the
following:

1. Stepper motor mounting holes and shaft hole. 
	1. The stepper motor details are
	 [here](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/product-files/324/C140-A+datasheet.jpg)
	1. You will need 5 holes: 4 for the mounting screws, and one for the shaft
		 in the middle.
1. An 8mm rod at a suitable distance. 
	1. Use the gears and timing belt I showed you in class, and estimate
		what a suitable distance would be. Remember that you want the belt to be
		loose, so that the idler pulley has something to do. It doesn't matter
		which gears and belt you use; again, this is just to learn the process.
1. A slot that a 5mm rod can move in. This is for the idler pulley, and it
	 needs a slot so that it can move towards the belt
1. 4 mounting holes in the corners to attach your structure to something. Not
	 critical.

#### Homework due Monday February 17

1. Read [Motors and Selecting the Right
	 One](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/motors-and-selecting-the-right-one)
1. Read [this](images/machineArtInTheTwentiethCentury.pdf) selection from Machine Art In The Twentieth Century
	1. Chose one of the authors, artists, concepts, or other topics to research
		 and on which to give a short (5 minute) presentation
1. Use the laser cutter to cut your design on cardboard
