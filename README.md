### Course Description

#### Using machines to build machines

The saying goes, "If all you have is a hammer, then every problem looks like a
nail." What if all you have is a 3D Printer?  In this course, students will be
introduced to, and engage critically with, a range of contemporary machines
inside and around the Interactive Media Lab. Leveraging historical
perspectives, current use-cases, and hands-on making, the course will explore
how machines enhance, or limit, our creative processes. Readings and
discussion will be paired with practical designing, prototyping, and making of
creative computer controlled devices, such as drawing machines, musical
instruments, and a collaborative Rube Goldberg contraption. Over the course of
the semester, students will be exposed to a variety of tools, materials, and
fabrication techniques as well as learn how to use micro-controllers and
software to give their machines unique behaviors and abilities. By thinking
about machines, using machines, and making machines, the course will offer
insight into our creative relationships with our tools.


The four projects will be:
- Automata (hand crank and motorized)
- Computer controlled drawing machine
- Computer controlled musical instrument
- Computer controlled Rube Goldberg chain reaction machine (class project)

Students will exhibit their classwork twice:
once around midterm and once 
in the Interactive Media End of Semester show. 
Participation in both of these events is mandatory.
