## Monday 3 February 2020 10:25 AM - 1:05 PM

**Administration**
- Label shelves

**Be excellent to the lab**
- It is super critical to keep tools, parts, and the lab in general neat.
- If tools or parts can't be found it's the same as them not existing and it
	holds everyone up including me
- If you don't know where something goes ask me or a lab manager or a lab
	monitor. If no one in the lab knows leave it on your shelf and send me
	email.
- Always (**Always!**) leave the lab cleaner than you found it. Clean up 
whatever mess you made, and a little more
- We are going to be making more stuff than any other class, so if there
    is a mess, everyone will know it's us.
- If I find out that you are being a bad lab citizen, it will affect your
	grade


**Do Along with Me**
- Motor Shield
- Stepper motor

**Time Permitting**
- Circuits
- Voltage and Current
- Transistors and Motors

**Creating a design for the laser cutter**

#### Homework due Wednesday February 12

Do your best to create the design I sketched on the board for the laser cutter.
The purpose of this assignment is not necessarily to finish the design
perfectly, but to get practice using Illustrator. You will need holes for the
following:

1. Stepper motor mounting holes and shaft hole. 
	1. The stepper motor details are
	 [here](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/product-files/324/C140-A+datasheet.jpg)
	1. You will need 5 holes: 4 for the mounting screws, and one for the shaft
		 in the middle.
1. An 8mm rod at a suitable distance. 
	1. Use the gears and timing belt I showed you in class, and estimate
		what a suitable distance would be. Remember that you want the belt to be
		loose, so that the idler pulley has something to do. It doesn't matter
		which gears and belt you use; again, this is just to learn the process.
1. A slot that a 5mm rod can move in. This is for the idler pulley, and it
	 needs a slot so that it can move towards the belt
1. 4 mounting holes in the corners to attach your structure to something.
	 Placement is not critical.

![](images/stepperMotorMechanism.jpg)

#### Homework due Monday February 17

1. Read [Motors and Selecting the Right
	 One](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/motors-and-selecting-the-right-one)
1. Read [this](images/machineArtInTheTwentiethCentury.pdf) selection from Machine Art In The Twentieth Century
	1. Chose one of the authors, artists, concepts, or other topics to research
		 and on which to give a short (5 minute) presentation. We will chose dates
		 later.
1. Finish your design for the laser cut project. 
	- Remember to enlarge the hole in the middle of the stepper motor to allow
		for the wide shoulder of the motor. It should be about 23mm in diameter.
	- Remember that now we have both a front and a back
	- Book an appointment on the laser cutter
	- You will first cut your project from cardboard. Make sure all the parts
		fit, and then cut it out of acrylic.
		- Stepper motor
		- 8mm shaft
		- 5mm shaft
		- hole for rubber band
		- 4 holes in the corners for the long bolts
	- If you want to fit everything together, I left the long bolts in our
		special rolling cart, in the bin with the USB cables.

## Monday 17 February 2020 10:25 AM - 1:05 PM

- Dates for presentations
- Work on mechanism

#### Homework due Wednesday February 19 
1. Modify your design for the laser cut acrylic pieces so that the belt 
can be properly tentioned. Remember what I suggested in class, of making
a number of holes so that you can adjust the distance to the 8mm rod.
1. Book an appointment with the laser cutter (do this now, before 
the appointments are taken) and cut your new pieces of acrylic
1. Assemble your mechanism and test that the motor can turn the 8mm shaft
	 reliably

## Wednesday 19 February 2020 11:50 AM - 1:05 PM

	 array. If these are new to you please Google "Arduino Tone" and Arduino
	 Array" and read about these. I will go over this in class, but do your best
	 to prepare.  (Note that this example does not use a class; that would be
	 the next stage.)

1. Sketch a design for some sort of mechanical contraption 
that uses the stepper motor, servo motor, and linkages. This can be hand
drawn. Don't make this too complex, and don't worry about making this too
detailed as it will probably change.
We will work on this together next week in the Scene Shop.

	1. Make a new folder in your Github repository called "midterm"  

	1. In the new folder "midterm" create a file called "readme.md"

	1. Upload a picture of your sketch to the same folder

	1. In the file "readme.md" include the picture

**Plan moving forward**

As you all realize the health situation is going to affect the way this course
is delivered. I hope that after the 4 weeks are up we can return to the lab
and the scene shop and do more building.

Meanwhile, we will continue to develop our projects as much as we can
virtually. I plan to deliver further training using online methods, probably
Zoom, which is integrated in NYU Classes.

To continue designing and testing mechanical contraptions, we will utilize
[Fusion
360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/students-teachers-educators).
Much more than Illustrator, Fusion 360 allows you to model components of
mechanisms and then to animate them, in other words to simulate actual
mechanisms.
This will allow us to develop concepts, and will prepare us for the final
project.

I will assign you to read/watch some Lynda tutorials to prepare you for
working with Fusion 360.

Since we are moving entirely online, you do no need to
take any of your equipment to your room. However, I do want you to thoroughly 
document
the current state of your mechanism by taking careful pictures of all aspects
of your work so far. If it is not yet assembled, take pictures of whatever
parts you have prepared. Organize them as closely as possible to how you
planned to assemble them.

**As you've read, tomorrow (Saturday March 7) is the last day you will have
access to the IM lab. It is thus important that you take these pictures
immediately.**

I will write further regarding how I want you to document your project and
when this documentation is due. For now, just take lots of pictures.

#### Revised Homework due Monday March 16

**Do and Watch**

We will be learning how to use Fusion 360 to create our designs.
Fusion 360 is a powerful Computer Aided Design (CAD) system
which is free for educational uses.

1. Download and install Fusion 360 from
	 [here](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/students-teachers-educators#).

	 1.1. You will be required to make an account. 
	 When asked for name of educational
	 institution chose New York University, New York.

	 1.1. After logging in, you will be given access to Fusion 360, 
	 which you can then download and install.

1. Watch the following sections from 
[Fusion 360 Essential
Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/fusion-360-essential-training-2/use-fusion-360-to-turn-your-ideas-into-designs)

	1.1. Optional: Section 1: Introduction to Fusion 360

	1.1. All videos in section 2: Creating Basic Shapes

	1.1. All videos in section 3: Planning Your Design

1. Click on Zoom from the options on the left  
1. Select the Cloud Recordings tab  

#### Homework due Wednesday March 18

1. Do your best to create the design we made with Illustrator (diagram above).
The purpose of this assignment is not necessarily to finish the design
perfectly, but to get practice using Fusion 360. 
Remember to use parameters for all dimensions.
You will need holes for the following:
	1. Stepper motor mounting holes and shaft hole. 
		1. The stepper motor details are
		 [here](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/product-files/324/C140-A+datasheet.jpg)
		1. You will need 5 holes: 4 for the mounting screws, and one for the shaft
			 in the middle.
	1. An 8mm rod at a suitable distance. 
		1. Use the gears and timing belt I showed you in class, and estimate
			what a suitable distance would be. Remember that you want the belt to be
			loose, so that the idler pulley has something to do. It doesn't matter
		which gears and belt you use; again, this is just to learn the process.
	1. 4 mounting holes in the corners to attach your structure to something.
		 Placement is not critical.
1. Browser the [McMaster-Carr]() website a little 
	1. See if you can find the timing gears that we used. 
	1. See if you can attach a gear to the motor shaft.
1. Document as best you can the work you did for the midterm project (due
	 Monday March 30)

#### Wednesday March 18 (11:50 - 1:05)

Continue working on your design, practice using Fusion 360. Here are the
parameters I used, you don't have to do the same:

![](images/stepperMotorAssyParams.png)

#### Homework due Monday March 30 

Some of you made excellent progress, others less so. Some of you appear
to have not put in much time. Learning CAD takes time, and the 
only way to get good at it is to put in the time. 

1. Watch the following tutorials: 
	1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C03H_YZHuAI
	1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QisfRW0pd44

	1. Four bolts to hold the two halves together (MCM # 91280A396)
	1. Nuts (MCM # 90591A151) as needed, joined to the proper surfaces
	1. Pulley for motor (MCM # 3684N11)
		1. I couldn't find a bigger pulley for the 8MM shaft, so not needed
	1. 8mm shaft. Design your own since the only one MCM carries 
		(# 1265K68) is almost a meter long!
1. Upload your documentation for the midterm project to Github
	1. Create a folder called "midterm"
	1. Upload images
	1. Create a README.md file, in which you describe your project and include

#### Homework due Wednesday April 1

#### Wednesday April 1 (11:50 - 1:05)

**Final Projec**

* We will make a clock
* Michael will make the timekeeping part and the frame
* Each one of you will make a mechanism that reflects something you are
	excited about or is representative of you. This could be a hobby or
	something that you enjoy doing. 
* Be creative. Inspiration can come from the cardboard project that we did at
	the beginning of class, the clocks that I linked above, or anything else.
	Please share interesting resources.
* The size is flexible, but keep in mind the limitations of the motors 
that we have.
* The frame will be out of metal and reasonably strong
* You mechanism must have a metal base which will be bolted to the frame
* Your mechanism should include your Arduino which will control the behavior
	of your mechanism
* Your mechanism should have different levels of activity e.g. a low level
	which might be activated on the quarter hour, a medium level on the half
	hour, and a high level which will be activated on the hour. You can have as
	many levels as you want, and you can choose when you want them activated
	(will will discuss this further). 
* The main clock will send you signals for the different times that you want
	to be activated
* Leave room on your base for your power supplies, e.g. one for your Arduino
	and one for your motor (and possibly a third if you have a motor with a
	different voltage e.g. servo motor).

The goal is to get all parts designed and fabricated this semester, and then
next fall we will assemble the clock

#### Homework due Monday April 6

* Preliminary sketch of your mechanism
* Think about the following in as much detail as you can:
	* The base and how things will be attached to it
	* What motors you need
	* How will your parts will be fabricated
	* What materials your parts will be made from. (aluminum, steel, acrylic)
	* The different levels of activity 
* If you need parts that we don't have, use parts from McMaster Carr. We can
	order those easily and you get the CAD model.
* Follow along with the three joint videos and make those joints 


#### Monday April 6 (10:25 - 1:05)

* Limit switches 
* [Big
	motors](https://www.amazon.com/uxcell-Reversible-Turbine-Electric-Gearbox/dp/B071KSMKYN/)
* Any questions or problems with joints?
* Take a look at your proposed mechanisms
* In-class work time: start constructing your mechanism


[Drawing machine using cams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pokSViy6Eck) (for
Alyazia)

#### Homework due Wednesday April 9

I want to see progress every time we meet. In order to demonstrate your
progress, you will keep a journal for your final project.


1. If you have not done so, create a new folder in your Github repository
	 called "final" or "finalProject"
1. In this new folder create a file README.md (if you've not already done so).
	 This will be your journal
1. In your journal, include the pictures of what you had prepared for Monday.
1. Your assignment for Wednesday is to refine your design, adding details.
	 Think about the following for each piece. You don't need to have all the
	 answers yet, but for as many as you can:
	1. Dimensions
	1. What materials you will use for each piece?
	1. How will you design it in Fusion 360?
	1. What machine will be used to fabricate each piece?
	1. How each piece will attach to the rest? Glue? Bolts? 
1. Put the date separating each section so I can tell what you have done
	 before, and what is new today.

We are planning a virtual end-of-semester showcase which will tentatively happen in conjunction with New York ITP/IMA on **May 17th, 8–10pm GST**. (New York is doing it on both 17th and 18th. We will be joining only on the 17th and Shanghai will be joining only on the 18th.)

You are all encouraged to participate. If you want to participate you will be responsible for:

* Creating your own online presence for your final project. This can be on any platform: WordPress, Github, Wix, whatever you chose

* Entering your project information into the ITP Project Database (title, description, link to online presence, etc)

* Being live on Zoom during the event (either set up your own Zoom session or join a Zoom session that faculty hosts, to be decided)

Would you be interested in participating?

**Student Presentation**

Max: Pierre Jaquet Droz

Thank you Max for your presentation on those amazing automatons

Thank you all for attending class and showing your work today. I see good
progress.

The people fabricating our parts are having trouble getting our files
from Github, so here is the correct procedure:

1. Put your STL (for 3D printing) or DXF (for laser cutting) files into a Google Drive folder. 
1. If you have both STL and DXF files put them in separate folders
1. Email me with the link(s)
1. I will forward your links to the appropriate people, and copy you.

On Wednesday Carlos will present on  Meyerhold 

#### Monday April 27 (10:25 - 1:05)

Ramadan Kareem everyone! 

1. Note to self: Record the meeting
1. I have consulted with other faculty and we have decided that the work you show in the virtual showcase should be from this class only, and should not include other work you have done. However, you can show any and all work that you have done in this class.
1. I realize that Fusion is tricky to learn, and some of us do better with hand drawings or using other programs. You are allowed to use whatever system works best for you.
1. No eating in class out of respect for Ramadan
1. We have a presentation by Ivory today
1. On Wednesday Alyazia will present

Here are the links that were used in class today:

1. 3D printed [snap-fit pivots](http://eikimartinson.com/engineering/3dparts/#pivot) found by Vince. 
This page includes information about 3-D printing threads and a dovetail joint, useful for attaching 
pieces together at right angles without screws.
1. 3D printed [hub](https://grabcad.com/library/clamping-hub-for-5mm-shaft) found by Alyazia
1. [Another](http://yeggi.com) and [another](https://www.stlfinder.com/) source for 3D models. 
Found these while searching for shaft couplers and servo motor mounts. Note these are just search engines
which find the models on other sites, such as [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/).
1. [This](https://grabcad.com/library/57335) looks like a model for the high-torque gearmotor we have, although I can't be sure.

**Virtual Showcase deadline Friday May 8:**

If you want to participate in the Spring 2020 Abu Dhabi, 
Shanghai,and New York City Virtual Showcase, you must enter initial
information about your project into the 
[projects database](https://itp.nyu.edu/projects/) by Friday May 8.
You'll associate your project with the venue "The Virtual Show Spring 2020".

[Here](https://youtu.be/TNjf2i1Ioq4)
is a video on how to enter your project. 
The video mentions adding a Zoom link. You can ignore this because NYUAD
is not participating in the live Zoom portion of the event.

Details to follow on how visitors can access the showcase.
Since it's virtual, this is the first time a showcase is not restricted to 
local visitors.

**Class Notes**
1. To copy a component, you first need to convert it to a body 
1. [Shaft coupler for two different sized
	 shafts](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:245023)
1. Servo motor models, various options: [this(https://grabcad.com/library/mg90s-servomotor-1)
, [this](https://gallery.autodesk.com/projects/132949/sg90-9g-micro-servo)
, or
[this](https://gallery.autodesk.com/fusion360/projects/136284/servo-motor-sg90)
.
1. Stepper motor size is NEMA 17. Different motors might have different
lengths, but they all have the same width, height, and shaft diameter.
Our motors are either from [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/324)
or [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9238).
Both have datasheets which is where you find the precise dimensions.
