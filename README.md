### Course Description

Using machines to build machines

In this class you will learn
how to use a range of machine tools and develop skills and techniques
allowing you to
conceive of, design, and construct computer controlled
electromechanical machines that are 
functional, robust, and reliable. 
Using these tools and skills we will build 4
projects:
- Automata (hand crank and motorized)
- Computer controlled drawing machine
- Computer controlled musical instrument
- Computer controlled Rube Goldberg chain reaction machine (class project)
