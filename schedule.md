- Introductions
- Syllabus
- Summary:
  -  Be present and participate in class
  -  No electronic distractions
  -  Be proactive: Communicate with me regarding difficulties, problems, illness, etc.
  -  Allow lots of time for homework as physical construction
  and debugging circuits and programs can be very time consuming.
- Announcements
  - Become a lab assistant! The application deadline is Feb 3rd at 11:59 pm.
    It's on CareerNet, or contact Ume (uh242@nyu.edu)

#### Homework due Monday February 4 
- **Read**
	- [Machinations-Mechanisms](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses/blob/master/doc/machinations-mechanisms.pdf)
	- [Basic Mechanisms](http://www.mechanical-toys.com/mechanisums.htm)

- **Do**
	- Build a hand crank machine using a crank and any other mechanism (linkage,
	cam, etc. Your machine must operate smoothly without sticking or falling
	apart for at least 30 seconds. 

- **Optional**
	- Browse [Mechatronics
 Resources](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#mechatronic-resources)

#### Monday 4 February 2019 10:25 AM - 1:05 PM

**Share Projects**
- What did you learn?
- Critique

**Administration**
- Add Github accounts
- Label shelves
- Homework is not optional

**Good lab citizenship**
- It is super critical to keep tools, parts, and the lab in general neat.
- If tools or parts can't be found it's the same as them not existing and it
	holds everyone up including me
- If you don't know where something goes ask me or a lab manager or a lab
	monitor. If no one in the lab knows leave it on your shelf and send me
	email.
- Always (**Always!**) leave the lab cleaner than you found it. Clean up 
whatever mess you made, and a little more
- We are going to be making most stuff than any other class, so if there
    is a mess, everyone will know it's us.
- If I find out that you are being a bad lab citizen, it will affect your
	grade

**Demo**
Soldering
- wires to wires
- wires to boards
- wires to motors

**Demo**
Using 5V from Arduino to power motor


### current-homework-assignment

#### Homework due Wednesday February 6
- Practice soldering until you feel confident
	- Wires to wires
	- Wires to boards from the scrap board box
- When you feel confident, get a motor and solder wires to it
	- Make sure you are using **stranded** wires! Ask if you are not sure!
	- Use any two color you wish **except** red and black

#### Wednesday 6 February 2019 11:50 AM - 1:05 PM

**Check in**
- Who did not solder wires to their motors?
- Who used solid core wire instead of stranded wire?

**Lecture** (tentative)
- Introduction to Electricity
- How to use Arduino as a power supply for your motor
	- **Be very careful not to let the wires touch any other parts of your board
		as this may cause a short circuit**

**In Class Activity**
- Distribute Arduino and USB cables
- Twist strands tightly
- Connect Arduino to your laptop via USB
- Observe motor turning
- Add wheels (be aware that motor will turn and try to run away)

**Demo** (time permitting)
- Solder a small length of **solid** core wire to the end of your **stranded** wire to make it easier to insert into your Arduino

#### Homework due Monday February 11 (tentative)
- Mount motor to your project to make it turn
	- It must turn for 30 seconds without breaking
	- You may need to strengthen or even rebuild your project
