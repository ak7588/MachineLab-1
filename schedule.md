#### Homework due Wednesday 24 January 
- **Update**
	- "Cabaret Mechanical Movements" is now available in the bookstore
	- Some bookstore staff members don't seem to know where our books are.
		If you are told they are not available ask for Jocelyn.
- **Read**
	- [Machinations-Mechanisms](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses/blob/master/doc/machinations-mechanisms.pdf)
	- [Basic Mechanisms](http://www.mechanical-toys.com/mechanisums.htm)
	- Both soldering tutorials
[here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#soldering)

- **Do**
	- Build a hand crank machine using a crank and any other mechanism (linkage,
	cam, etc. Your machine must operate smoothly without sticking or falling
	apart for at least 30 seconds. 
	- Create a GitHub account and create a repository for this class. 
	[Here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#github-resources)
	are some instructions
	- Label your shelf

- **Optional**
	- Browse [Mechatronics
 Resources](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#mechatronic-resources)

#### Wednesday 24 January 9am - 11:40
- Lab orientation with Ume
- Review syllabus / schedule
- Soldering demo (twisting, touching, heat shrink tubing)
- Solder wires to motors demo (stranded, strain relief, solid tips)
- Test (Arduino, USB cable, 5V)
- Lab: Put wires on your motors and test them
- Activity: Mechanize your crank machines

### current-homework-assignment
#### Homework due Monday 29 January 
- **Update**
- **Read**
	- [Getting Started with Arduino / Genuino Uno
		tutorial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoUno). There are many
		excellent resources on this so if you don't like this guide feel free to
		find another. Sparkfun and Adafruit have particularly good guides. You can
		also find many videos if you prefer that.
	- Sparkfun's [How to Use a
		Breadboard](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard)
		tutorial. Again there are many other resources on line, feel free to find
		and read another if you prefer.
- **Do**
	- Motorize the mechanical device you made for today. Use your Arduino 
	to power the device by connecting one wire to 5V and the other wire to GND
	(either GND; they are all the same).
	Your machine must operate smoothly without sticking or falling
	apart for at least **one minute**. 
	- Email me the link to your GitHub repository 
	- Label your shelf
	- Do the [Getting Started with Arduino / Genuino Uno
		tutorial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoUno). Your goal is to
		install the software, upload Blink which is the most simple example, and
		observe that everything works properly
	- In the Blink example look for the line that says 
	`delay(1000);`. 
	This is
		what controls the blink rate: The first
	`delay(1000);` controls the amount of time the LED is on, and the second
	controls the amount of time it's off. Change both of these to `100` and
	verify that the blink rate changes.
