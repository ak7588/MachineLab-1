- **Optional**
	- Browse [Mechatronics
 Resources](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#mechatronic-resources)

#### Monday 4 February 2019 10:25 AM - 1:05 PM

**Share Projects**
- What did you learn?
- Critique

**Administration**
- Add Github accounts
- Label shelves
- Homework is not optional

**Good lab citizenship**
- It is super critical to keep tools, parts, and the lab in general neat.
- If tools or parts can't be found it's the same as them not existing and it
	holds everyone up including me
- If you don't know where something goes ask me or a lab manager or a lab
	monitor. If no one in the lab knows leave it on your shelf and send me
	email.
- Always (**Always!**) leave the lab cleaner than you found it. Clean up 
whatever mess you made, and a little more
- We are going to be making most stuff than any other class, so if there
    is a mess, everyone will know it's us.
- If I find out that you are being a bad lab citizen, it will affect your
	grade

**Demo**
Soldering
- wires to wires
- wires to boards
- wires to motors

**Demo**
Using 5V from Arduino to power motor


#### Homework due Wednesday February 6
- Practice soldering until you feel confident
	- Wires to wires
	- Wires to boards from the scrap board box
- When you feel confident, get a motor and solder wires to it
	- Make sure you are using **stranded** wires! Ask if you are not sure!
	- Use any two color you wish **except** red and black

#### Wednesday 6 February 2019 11:50 AM - 1:05 PM

**Check in**
- Who did not solder wires to their motors?
- Who used solid core wire instead of stranded wire?

**Lecture** 
- Introduction to Electricity
- How to use Arduino as a power supply for your motor
	- **Be very careful not to let the wires touch any other parts of your board
		as this may cause a short circuit**

**In Class Activity**
- Distribute Arduino and USB cables
- Twist strands tightly
- Insert wires into Arduino carefully
	- **Be very careful not to let the wires touch any other parts of your board
		as this may cause a short circuit**
- Connect Arduino to your laptop via USB
- Observe motor turning
- High five your neighbor
- Disconnect USB to stop the emotor
- Add wheels (be aware that motor will turn and try to run away)
- Re-connect USB to start the emotor

**Demo** (time permitting)
- Solder a small length of **solid** core wire to the end of your **stranded** wire to make it easier to insert into your Arduino

#### Homework due Monday February 11

- Mount motor to your project to make it turn
	- It must turn for 30 seconds without breaking
	- You may need to strengthen or even rebuild your project
- Download the Arduino IDE (ARDUINO 1.8.8) from
    [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
    Scroll down past the "Arduino Web Editor" to "Download the Arduino IDE". Select the appropriate download (if you are on Windows you probably want the Windows Installer). On the next page you will be asked if you want to contribute to Arduino Software. Scroll down a little and you will see a button that says "Just Download".
  - Try to install it if you can but don’t worry if you have trouble.
    We’ll do that in class.

#### Wednesday 6 February 2019 11:50 AM - 1:05 PM

**Announcements**
- [24x](https://nyuad.im/24x/)  
	In the spirit of Rhizome’s Seven on Seven and Experiments in Art's  Technology’s “9 Evenings”, NYUAD Interactive Media presents The 4th Annual 24X.  

	24X is an event where 10 students from diverse disciplines come together for 24 hours to create something new.   

	In teams of 2, participants will collaborate on an original project of their choice - a game, a performance, a poem, a sculpture, a mobile app - it’s up to the team and their imaginations to decide!   

	After being introduced to each other, each pair will have 24 hours to come up with an idea, prototype it, and present their project to the NYUAD community. Teams will share their process and reflections on the experience.   

	A theme will be revealed at the outset of the event to inspire the work. Faculty mentors will be on hand throughout the event to provide support.   

- Visit to Zimoun's project next Monday at 10:25. Meet in the Art Gallery.
	Attendence will be taken

- Github
	- First, let me add all your repositories to our README.md file
	- How to create a file
	- How to create a .md file
	- How to create a folder (directory)
	- [Here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#github-resources) are some more resources

#### Revised Homework due Monday February 18

- Announcement
	- Zimoun's workshop

- Prepare for Zimoun visit
	- Watch some o zimoun's work
	- Think of at least one question to ask
	
- Watch these Lynda video tutorials on Fusion 360: (less than 20 minutes
	total):
	- 3.1 User Interface Overview
	- 3.2 Navigating inside F360
	- 3.3 Model Environment
	- 3.5 Sketch Environment
	- 4.1 Extrude a 3D object
	- Optional
		- 4.4 Add or Subtract objects from other objects
		- 8 Introduction to sketching: Raspberry Pi Case
	
- Download and install Fusion 360, either
	- Free [30 day
		trial](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/free-trial)
	- Make a [student
		account](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/students-teachers-educators) and get a free 3 year license

- Try to design a box into which you can mount a [Nema 17
	motor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/324) and two
	[flanged
	bearings](https://openbuildspartstore.com/flanged-bearing-688zz-8x16x5/)
	![](images/boxPicture.jpg)
	- You will need to determine the positions and size of the mounting holes
		and the shoulder around the shaft so that the motor can be mounted in your
		box. Use [this](https://reprap.org/wiki/NEMA_17_Stepper_motor) 
		for the standard Nema 17 dimensions. 
	- The bearings are there to support a
		[shaft](https://www.servocity.com/5mm-stainless-steel-precision-shafting)  
		that runs through the front and
		back of the box, so the bearing in the back needs to line up with the
		bearing in front
