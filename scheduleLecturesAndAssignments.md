## Monday 3 February 2020 10:25 AM - 1:05 PM

**Administration**
- Label shelves

**Be excellent to the lab**
- It is super critical to keep tools, parts, and the lab in general neat.
- If tools or parts can't be found it's the same as them not existing and it
	holds everyone up including me
- If you don't know where something goes ask me or a lab manager or a lab
	monitor. If no one in the lab knows leave it on your shelf and send me
	email.
- Always (**Always!**) leave the lab cleaner than you found it. Clean up 
whatever mess you made, and a little more
- We are going to be making more stuff than any other class, so if there
    is a mess, everyone will know it's us.
- If I find out that you are being a bad lab citizen, it will affect your
	grade


**Do Along with Me**
- Motor Shield
- Stepper motor

**Time Permitting**
- Circuits
- Voltage and Current
- Transistors and Motors

**Creating a design for the laser cutter**

#### Homework due Wednesday February 12

Do your best to create the design I sketched on the board for the laser cutter.
The purpose of this assignment is not necessarily to finish the design
perfectly, but to get practice using Illustrator. You will need holes for the
following:

1. Stepper motor mounting holes and shaft hole. 
	1. The stepper motor details are
	 [here](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/product-files/324/C140-A+datasheet.jpg)
	1. You will need 5 holes: 4 for the mounting screws, and one for the shaft
		 in the middle.
1. An 8mm rod at a suitable distance. 
	1. Use the gears and timing belt I showed you in class, and estimate
		what a suitable distance would be. Remember that you want the belt to be
		loose, so that the idler pulley has something to do. It doesn't matter
		which gears and belt you use; again, this is just to learn the process.
1. A slot that a 5mm rod can move in. This is for the idler pulley, and it
	 needs a slot so that it can move towards the belt
1. 4 mounting holes in the corners to attach your structure to something.
	 Placement is not critical.

#### Homework due Monday February 17

1. Read [Motors and Selecting the Right
	 One](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/motors-and-selecting-the-right-one)
1. Read [this](images/machineArtInTheTwentiethCentury.pdf) selection from Machine Art In The Twentieth Century
	1. Chose one of the authors, artists, concepts, or other topics to research
		 and on which to give a short (5 minute) presentation. We will chose dates
		 later.
1. Finish your design for the laser cut project. 
	- Remember to enlarge the hole in the middle of the stepper motor to allow
		for the wide shoulder of the motor. It should be about 23mm in diameter.
	- Remember that now we have both a front and a back
	- Book an appointment on the laser cutter
	- You will first cut your project from cardboard. Make sure all the parts
		fit, and then cut it out of acrylic.
		- Stepper motor
		- 8mm shaft
		- 5mm shaft
		- hole for rubber band
		- 4 holes in the corners for the long bolts
	- If you want to fit everything together, I left the long bolts in our
		special rolling cart, in the bin with the USB cables.

## Monday 17 February 2020 10:25 AM - 1:05 PM

- Dates for presentations
- Work on mechanism

#### Homework due Wednesday February 19 
1. Modify your design for the laser cut acrylic pieces so that the belt 
can be properly tentioned. Remember what I suggested in class, of making
a number of holes so that you can adjust the distance to the 8mm rod.
1. Book an appointment with the laser cutter (do this now, before 
the appointments are taken) and cut your new pieces of acrylic
1. Assemble your mechanism and test that the motor can turn the 8mm shaft
	 reliably

## Wednesday 19 February 2020 11:50 AM - 1:05 PM

		- Tiny screws
		- Wood?
		- Acrylic?
		- Aluminium?
- Controlling servo motors
- Inputs and outputs, digital and analog

#### Homework due Monday February 24

1. Read, and try to understand, [Multi-tasking the Arduino, Part
	 1](https://learn.adafruit.com/multi-tasking-the-arduino-part-1?view=all)
1. The code for the stepper motor, switch, and potentiometer is
	 [here](src/stepperMotorPotAndSwitch/stepperMotorPotAndSwitch.ino)
1. Remember to dress for the Scene Shop training: closed toes shoes, long
	 pants, no loose sleeves, tie back long hair

## Monday 24 February 2020 10:25 AM - 1:05 PM

1. 10:25 - 11:15am: Try to understand, [Multi-tasking the Arduino, Part
	 1](https://learn.adafruit.com/multi-tasking-the-arduino-part-1?view=all)

1. 11:15am - 11:30: Break

1. 11:30-1pm Scene shop training

#### Homework due Wednesday February 26

1. Read about linkages in
	 [this](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses/blob/master/doc/howToDesignAndMakeAutomata_RobertAdams.pdf)
	 or
	 [this](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses/blob/master/doc/howToDesignAndMakeSimpleAutomata_RobertAdams.pdf)
	 (I think they are two versions of the same book. If you prefer video
	 tutorials there are many online, Google for something like "linkages
	 tutorials" (If you find any good ones let me know.)

1. Read and try to understand
	 [toneMelodyAndBlinkWithoutDelay](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/toneMelodyAndBlinkWithoutDelay/blob/master/toneMelodyAndBlinkWithoutDelay.ino). 
	 There are some new concepts here: the tone() command and the concept of an
	 array. If these are new to you please Google "Arduino Tone" and Arduino
	 Array" and read about these. I will go over this in class, but do your best
	 to prepare.  (Note that this example does not use a class; that would be
	 the next stage.)

1. Sketch a design for some sort of mechanical contraption 
that uses the stepper motor, servo motor, and linkages. This can be hand
drawn. Don't make this too complex, and don't worry about making this too
detailed as it will probably change.
We will work on this together next week in the Scene Shop.

	1. Make a new folder in your Github repository called "midterm"  

	1. In the new folder "midterm" create a file called "readme.md"

	1. Upload a picture of your sketch to the same folder

	1. In the file "readme.md" include the picture

	1. If you need some help with github, look
	[here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#github-resources).
	You can also look at this file (click the "raw" button) 
	to see how I've included images

1. Remember that on Wednesdays we will have our student presentations. This
	 week Tonia will present on Russian Constructivism

**Plan moving forward**

As you all realize the health situation is going to affect the way this course
is delivered. I hope that after the 4 weeks are up we can return to the lab
and the scene shop and do more building.

Meanwhile, we will continue to develop our projects as much as we can
virtually. I plan to deliver further training using online methods, probably
Zoom, which is integrated in NYU Classes.

To continue designing and testing mechanical contraptions, we will utilize
[Fusion
360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/students-teachers-educators).
Much more than Illustrator, Fusion 360 allows you to model components of
mechanisms and then to animate them, in other words to simulate actual
mechanisms.
This will allow us to develop concepts, and will prepare us for the final
project.

I will assign you to read/watch some Lynda tutorials to prepare you for
working with Fusion 360.

Since we are moving entirely online, you do no need to
take any of your equipment to your room. However, I do want you to thoroughly 
document
the current state of your mechanism by taking careful pictures of all aspects
of your work so far. If it is not yet assembled, take pictures of whatever
parts you have prepared. Organize them as closely as possible to how you
planned to assemble them.

**As you've read, tomorrow (Saturday March 7) is the last day you will have
access to the IM lab. It is thus important that you take these pictures
immediately.**

I will write further regarding how I want you to document your project and
when this documentation is due. For now, just take lots of pictures.
