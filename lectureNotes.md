#### Today's plan


This class is fast-paced, difficult, and time consuming.  You are all top
students, otherwise you wouldn't be at NYUAD. You have gotten here because of
your excellent academic abilities. Physical computing involves abilities which
are probably new to most of you: electronics, programming, mechanics, and
physical construction.  You are used to estimating how long an assignment or
project will take based on your past experiences. When the assignments require
skill with which you have little experience, your estimates can be very,
**very**, *very* wrong. Don't take this class if you aren't prepared to work
hard and invest the necessary amount of time.

On the other hand, I am here for you. I want to see you succeed. I like seeing
your projects succeed. You will find me very accessible and helpful. I am
online at all hours and can often solve problem via Discord. I'm also very
available in person and spend much time outside of class in the IM lab. You
can approach me at any time, but *you* must take the initiative and reach out
to me, and you must not wait until the last minute. You must try hard to solve
your problems, and if you can't solve them, you must reach out to me while
there is still time for me to help you.

In return I have expectations of you: I expect you to come to class on time
and to be fully present. I expect you to be fully engaged in the class, and to
fully participate in and contribute to class discussion. I expect you to work
hard, very hard, and to ask me for help when you run into problems.

I do not tolerate the use of cellphones or laptops in class for anything other
than what we're actively working on in class.  If you need any exceptions,
talk to me.  I strongly recommend that you take notes on paper.  In
particular, when I help you, I like being able to scribble on paper, so I'd
like each of you to have a notebook on hand when you ask for my help.

I understand that there is more going on in your life than this class, indeed
more than university. If there is stuff going on your life that is making it
difficult to get your work done, contact me via email and we'll work something
out. 

One last thing: I don't want to get sick, not from COVID, and not from any
other illness. If you're feeling sick, please stay at home and join the class
via Zoom.
