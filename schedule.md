#### Homework due Wednesday 24 January 
- **Update**
	- "Cabaret Mechanical Movements" is now available in the bookstore
	- Some bookstore staff members don't seem to know where our books are.
		If you are told they are not available ask for Jocelyn.
- **Read**
	- [Machinations-Mechanisms](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses/blob/master/doc/machinations-mechanisms.pdf)
	- [Basic Mechanisms](http://www.mechanical-toys.com/mechanisums.htm)
	- Both soldering tutorials
[here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#soldering)

- **Do**
	- Build a hand crank machine using a crank and any other mechanism (linkage,
	cam, etc. Your machine must operate smoothly without sticking or falling
	apart for at least 30 seconds. 
	- Create a GitHub account and create a repository for this class. 
	[Here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#github-resources)
	are some instructions
	- Label your shelf

- **Optional**
	- Browse [Mechatronics
 Resources](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#mechatronic-resources)
