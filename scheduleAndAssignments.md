**Administration**
- Add Github accounts

- Homework is not optional

**Good lab citizenship**
- It is super critical to keep tools, parts, and the lab in general neat.
- If tools or parts can't be found it's the same as them not existing and it
	holds everyone up including me
- If you don't know where something goes ask me or a lab manager or a lab
	monitor. If no one in the lab knows leave it on your shelf and send me
	email.
- Always (**Always!**) leave the lab cleaner than you found it. Clean up 
whatever mess you made, and a little more
- We are going to be making most stuff than any other class, so if there
    is a mess, everyone will know it's us.
- If I find out that you are being a bad lab citizen, it will affect your
	grade
